This my Python project generates and solves Sudoku puzzles. Here are the main features of the code:

## 🎲 Features

- **Sudoku Generation**: The code creates a random Sudoku puzzle with four difficulty levels:
  - **Easy** 🟢
  - **Medium** 🟡
  - **Hard** 🟠
  - **Extreme** 🔴

- **Visualization**: Upon execution, two windows will open:
  1. **Original Sudoku Window** 🧩: Displays the puzzle in its initial, unsolved state.
  2. **Solution Window** ✔️: Shows the complete solution of the Sudoku puzzle.

- **Solving Time**: For Sudoku puzzles with **Extreme** difficulty 🔴, solving can take a few minutes due to the puzzle's complexity.
